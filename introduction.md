clear documentation. Here are some recommendation to read first.

## Qonnodo Philosophy

Qonnodo is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must 
be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. 

Qonnodo aims to make the development process a pleasing one for the developer without sacrificing 
application functionality. Happy developers make the best code. To this end, we've attempted to 
combine the very best of what we have seen in other web frameworks, including frameworks implemented 
in other languages, such as Ruby on Rails, Laravel, and Django.

Qonnodo is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. 
A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit 
testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
