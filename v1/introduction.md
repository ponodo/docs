## Where to Start

Learning a new framework can be overwhelming, much think to learn, but also it can be
very exciting. To smooth your learning progress, we have attempted to create very
clear documentation. Here are some recommendation to read first.

- [Installing](installation.md) and [configuration](configuration.md)
- [Routing](routing.md)
- [Requests and input](requests.md)
- [Responses](responses.md)
- [Controllers](controllers.md)
- [Model](model.md)

## Ponodo Philosophy

Ponodo is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax for pythonista. We believe development must 
be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. 

Ponodo aims to make the development process a pleasing one for the developer without sacrificing 
application functionality. Happy developers make the best code. To this end, we've attempted to 
combine the very best of what we have seen in other web frameworks, including frameworks implemented 
in other languages, such as Ruby on Rails, Laravel, and Django.
